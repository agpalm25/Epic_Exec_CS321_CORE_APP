In this event, Community Advisors will be notified as to any impact on the employment dates and time frame as soon as possible and once those shifts are finalized.

        Dear {preferred_name},

        On behalf of the Office of Residential Experience, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest and participation in the Community Advisor selection process. This year's selection process for the Community Advisor position was extremely competitive, particularly given the quality of applicants seeking a role. This made position deliberations incredibly difficult. 

        After a complete assessment of our positions and communities and a full review of all potential candidates, we are unfortunately unable to offer you an official position at this immediate time. However, we are pleased to offer you an Alternate Community Advisor position. Our interview team was impressed with your skills, experiences, and enthusiasm, and we believe you have the skills to be a Community Advisor.

        Why should you consider the Alternate Community Advisor status?
        The role of the Alternate Community Advisor (CA) is critical if a CA position becomes available for the upcoming academic year
        It is not uncommon that Alternate Community Advisors may receive an offer as early as TBD, or throughout the summer (should positions become available).
        If a Community Advisor position does become available (including those created by CAs going abroad), we will consider our Alternate Community Advisor pool to choose a replacement.
        If a position becomes available, you will be considered if we believe you would be a good fit for the particular staff and floor/building community with the opening.

        In order to share your decision regarding this offer, please complete the following:
        Electronically accept or decline the offered position by no later than TBD

        Please understand that this is a conditional position offer. Serving as an Alternate Community Advisor for the upcoming academic year is contingent upon the successful completion of the following:
        Maintaining a minimum 2.50 cumulative grade point average (GPA) - GPAs will be checked after each semester. If you do not meet the GPA requirement, you will be notified; and
        Remaining in good student conduct standing with the College.

        Something to Keep in Mind: As an Alternate Community Advisor, you may receive an offer for a position. As such, all Community Advisors for the 2025-2026 academic year will be required to attend Fall Hall Staff Training beginning as early as TBD. Training and move-in preparations would continue through the first day of classes. Please be mindful of these dates should you receive an offer at any point.

        At any time after accepting this role, if you would like to remove yourself from consideration (due to accepting another position, no longer being interested, or for any other reason) or if you have any questions, please feel free to contact Kyle Arthenayake, Associate Director of Residential Education (karthena@colby.edu) or Shikha Shrestha, Assistant Director of Residential Education (shshrest@colby.edu).
